Tracking the budgets and expenses of the nation in line with its implementation of the targets, which are aligned with national development priorities, will give the opportunity for all stakeholders to assess how much the various goals and metrics have been accomplished over the years, laying the groundwork for determining how much more will be needed to realise the NSDP. The transparent reporting on government\u2019s spending to achieve the NSDP provides both Private Sector and Multilateral Development Partners the opportunity to determine which goals require more attention, or the Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) that require financial or technical assistance in working towards the achievement of the Goals. It also provides the Government the opportunity to adjust its allocations to ensure the equitable distribution of resources across MDAs. This reporting seeks to provide data that will enable the Government and its partners to monitor the progress being made on the various Goals against the investments made over the years to ascertain the efficient use of all financial resources.
