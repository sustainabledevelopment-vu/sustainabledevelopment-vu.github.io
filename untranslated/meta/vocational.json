The vocational education system offers a range of courses that cater to the diverse needs of students across the country. These courses are intended to provide students with practical skills and knowledge that can be  applied in various industries. However , there are still challenges in the vocational education  system, such as limited resources, outdated equipment, and inadequate training for teachers. Collaborations between government agencies, employers and educational institutions is essential to address these challenges and enhance the quality of vocational education in Vanuatu. Despite these challenges, there are promising developments, such as the establishment of the National Apprenticeship Scheme and other vocational training initiatives. These efforts aim to equip students with skills and knowledge they need to enter the workforce and contribute to the economic development of the country.
