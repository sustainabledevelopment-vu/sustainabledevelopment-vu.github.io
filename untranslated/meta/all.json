As a developing country labor statistics can play a crucial role in shaping the country's development goals. Here are some of the  significant  labor statistics in Vanuatu and how they can help the country achieve its development goals.\n\n1. Low employment rate\nVanuatu has a low employment rate of around 31%, and this can be seen as significant challenge  towards the country's development. this low employment rate can result  in limited job opportunities, lack of skills, or low education levels. To address this challenge, Vanuatu needs to invest in creating a conducive environment for businesses to grow, promoting entrepreneurship, and equipping the workforce with the  necessary skills for current labor market needs.\n\n2.High youth unemployment\nVanuatu also has a high youth unemployment rate of around 26%. Youth make up a significant portion of the population, and addressing their unemployment challenges is critical to the country's development. Encouraging entrepreneurship, vocational training, and promoting industries that can hire  and engage the youth can address this challenge.\n\n3.Informal sector dominance\nAround 80% of Vanuatu workforce is engaged in the informal sector, which often comes with low wages, limited job security, and poor working conditions. The government of Vanuatu can promote an enabling business environment, implement policies aimed at formalizing the informal sector, and offer incentives to the sector's actors to reduce the dominance of the informal sector in the economy.\n\n4.Gender gap\nVanuatu labor market experiences gender  gaps with women underrepresented in high-earning jobs or formal employment. Promoting gender equality, enacting laws that promote women's inclusion in the workforce, and creating awareness of gender disparities in the labor market can help bridge this gap.\n\nTherefore labor statistics play a crucial role in informing the country's development goals. Addressing the employment, youth employment, informal sector dominance, and gender equality may help Vanuatu bridge the economic disparities that deny many citizens access to essentials services and uplift their standards of  living.\n\n\n\n","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":true,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"","target_number":"labor","goal_number":"labor","indicator_sort_order":"labor"},"ECO3-6-1":{"indicator_number":"ECO3-6-1","goal_number":"ECO3","goal_name":"global_goals.ECO3-title","target_number":"ECO3-6","target_name":"global_targets.ECO3-6-title","indicator_name":"indicators.ECO3-6-1-title","PillarCode":"ECO","PillarDescription":"pillars.ECO","GoalId":"ECO3","GoalDescription":"global_goals.ECO3-title","PolicyObjectiveId":"ECO3-6","PolicyObjectiveDescription":"global_targets.ECO3-6-title","IndicatorId":"ECO3-6-1","IndicatorDescription":"indicators.ECO3-6-1-title","national_geographical_coverage":"Vanuatu","AlternativeDataSource":null,"Assumptions":null,"Calculation/Formulation":null,"ComputationMethod":"Distance = speed X Time\n* t = Find time taken from the nearest government facility to the nearest household.\n* s = Find the speed per hour from the nearest government facility to the nearest household\n* d = Calculate the average travelling distance to the nearest government service\n\n                   d =(s x t)/2","ComputationUnit":"speed per hour.\nTime in either minutes or hours","Concept":"* Government services delivered to the provincial area are accessible to all people in the provinces especially the location of government facilities and distance for people to travel to and from the government services to their place of stay.\n* The distance taken for individuals to travel from place of residence to gain access to government services such as schools and health facilities in relation to the population in the area is a indicator that that government uses to build better roads, and other important infrastructure that will allow easy access of that particular population to utilise these services.

in government revenue refers to the difference or variation in the amount of money collected by the government through various sources such as taxes, fees, fines, and other forms of revenue generation, typically measured over a specific period of time. It represents the increase or decrease in the total funds received by the government, which can have implications for budgetary planning, fiscal policy decisions, and the overall financial health of the government.","Concept":"The concept behind the indicator \"change in government revenue\" is to assess the variation in the total amount of funds collected by the government from various sources. It helps track the growth or decline in government income, which is essential for understanding the financial health of the government, evaluating the effectiveness of revenue policies, and making informed decisions regarding budget allocation, public spending, and fiscal planning. Monitoring changes in government revenue provides insights into the overall revenue generation capacity of the government and its ability to meet its financial obligations and support public services and programs.","Disaggregation":"By revenue sources: taxes, value added, excise, taxes on inter-trade & transactions, and other","Rationale":"The rationale behind monitoring the indicator \"change in government revenue\" is to understand the trends and fluctuations in the total funds collected by the government over time. It provides crucial information on the government's ability to generate income, sustain public services, meet financial obligations, and make informed decisions on budgetary allocations, tax policies, and expenditure planning. Monitoring changes in government revenue helps assess the financial health of the government and its capacity to support economic growth and address societal needs.","MethodOfComputation":"Percentage Change in Government Revenue = ((Revenue in the current period - Revenue in the previous period) / Revenue in the previous period) * 100\n\nThis formula determines the percentage difference between the revenue collected in the current period and the revenue collected in the previous period, relative to the revenue in the previous period.

These agreements typically cover a range of issues, such as the reduction or elimination of tariffs, the removal of non-tariff barriers, the facilitation of customs procedures, and the protection of intellectual property rights. The purpose of such agreements is to promote the flow of goods and services between participating countries, enhance market access, and foster economic growth and development. They are often negotiated and established through rounds of negotiations and can have a significant impact on international trade and economic relations.","Concept":" Trade by Trade agreement suggests a focus on the specific trade aspects or provisions within such agreements. It emphasizes the importance of trade-related policies, market access, tariffs, quotas, and regulations that directly impact the exchange of goods and services between participating countries.\n\nBy examining the trade provisions within a trade agreement, policymakers, economists, and analysts can evaluate the potential benefits, challenges, and implications for industries, consumers, and the overall economy. It allows for an assessment of how the agreement affects trade flows, market opportunities, and competitiveness, and provides insights into the impact on specific sectors or industries. Understanding the trade provisions in a trade agreement is crucial for businesses engaging in cross-border trade, as it shapes the rules and conditions under which they can access foreign markets and compete internationally.","Disaggregation":"exports, imports, balance,\nby country","Rationale":"The rationale behind monitoring trade by trade agreements as an indicator is to understand the economic relationships and trade dynamics between two or more specific countries. Trade by trade agreements are established to promote economic cooperation and reduce barriers to trade between the participating countries. Monitoring these agreements provides insights into the objectives, terms, and conditions of trade between the countries involved. It allows policymakers, businesses, and economists to assess the impact of these agreements on market access, tariff reductions, regulatory alignment, investment flows, and other trade-related aspects. Understanding bilateral trade agreements helps identify opportunities and challenges for businesses operating in the involved countries, evaluate the effectiveness of trade policies, and assess the potential for increased trade and economic cooperation between specific trading partners.","MethodOfComputation":"The computation methods can include the following:\n\n1. Total Trade Value: Calculate the total value of exports and imports between the countries involved in the multilateral trade agreement. This can be done by summing up the monetary value of all traded goods and services recorded in official trade statistics or trade databases.\n\n2. Trade Balance: Calculate the trade balance between the countries by subtracting the total value of imports from the total value of exports. A positive trade balance indicates that exports exceed imports, while a negative trade balance suggests that imports surpass exports.\n\n3. Tariff Revenue: Assess the tariff revenue generated from trade flows between the countries. This involves calculating the total amount of customs duties collected on imports and exports based on the agreed tariff rates. This information can be obtained from customs records or official government reports.\n\n4. Sector-specific Analysis: Conduct a sector-specific analysis to determine the value of trade in specific industries or sectors covered by the multilateral trade agreement. This can involve examining the monetary value of trade in key sectors and tracking changes over time to evaluate the impact of the agreement on those sectors.\n\n5. Preferential Tariff Analysis: Analyze the utilization of preferential tariff rates agreed upon in the multilateral trade agreement. Calculate the share of imports and exports that receive preferential treatment and assess the value of trade conducted at lower tariff rates as a result of the agreement.\n\nMonitoring multilateral trade agreements in monetary value requires access to reliable trade data, such as official trade statistics, customs records, and other relevant sources. Regular data collection, analysis, and comparison against the commitments and objectives of the agreement help assess the economic impact, trade patterns, and compliance with the agreed terms.","SDGAlignment":"17.11\n17.11.1\n(Tier 1)","UnitOfMeasurement":"Vatu in millions","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annual","source_organisation_1":"QSI December 2020, VBOS\nQSI December 2021, VBOS","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2023-06-26","national_data_updated_date":"2022-11-22","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"VT (vatu in millions)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Trade by trade agreement (value)","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Years","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ECO1-05-02"},"ENV1-5-2":{"indicator_number":"ENV1-5-2","goal_number":"ENV1","goal_name":"global_goals.ENV1-title","target_number":"ENV1-5","target_name":"global_targets.ENV1-5-title","indicator_name":"indicators.ENV1-5-2-title","PillarCode":"ENV","PillarDescription":"pillars.ENV","GoalId":"ENV1","GoalDescription":"global_goals.ENV1-title","PolicyObjectiveId":"ENV1-5","PolicyObjectiveDescription":"global_targets.ENV1-5-title","IndicatorId":"ENV1-5-2","IndicatorDescription":"indicators.ENV1-5-2-title","national_geographical_coverage":"Vanuatu","AlternativeDataSource":null,"Assumptions":null,"Calculation/Formulation":null,"ComputationMethod":"Number of species in the area \u00f7\u00a0total number of individuals in the area = biodiversity index","ComputationUnit":"* Total Count\n* Ratio\n","Concept":"Crop diversity loss threatens global food security, as the world's human population depends on a diminishing number of varieties of a diminishing number of crop species","DataSource":"Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries, Forestry and Biosecurity.

This indicator helps in evaluating the effectiveness of educational programs and interventions, identifying achievement gaps, and addressing educational inequalities. It guides educational policies and resource allocation, enabling targeted support for students who may be falling behind in literacy and numeracy skills. Additionally, tracking the percentage of students meeting these standards helps ensure that all students are equipped with the necessary skills for further academic pursuits, employment, and active participation in society.","MethodOfComputation":"The computation method for the \"Percentage of students meeting literacy and numeracy standards\" involves several steps:\n\n1. Standard Setting: A set of criteria or benchmarks is established to define the expected level of proficiency in literacy and numeracy skills for students at different grade levels or educational stages. These criteria may be based on national or international standards, educational frameworks, or curriculum guidelines.\n\n2. Assessment Administration: Students are assessed using various evaluation methods, such as standardized tests, examinations, or assessments specifically designed to measure literacy and numeracy skills. These assessments are typically administered to all registered students throughout the entire country.\n\n3. Scoring and Proficiency Determination: The assessment results are scored based on predetermined scoring rubrics or criteria that align with the established standards. The scores provide a measure of each student's proficiency level in literacy and numeracy skills both in English & French.\n\n4. Calculation of Percentage: The percentage of students meeting the literacy and numeracy standards is computed by determining the proportion of students who achieve or exceed the proficiency benchmark. This is done by dividing the number of students who meet the standards by the total number of students assessed and multiplying the result by 100.\n\n5. Reporting and Analysis: The computed percentage is reported to stakeholders, including educators, policymakers, and the public. It is often disaggregated by grade level, school, district, or other relevant demographics to identify variations and disparities in student performance.\n\nBy employing this computation method, education authorities can track the progress of students' literacy and numeracy skills over time, identify areas in need of improvement, and inform targeted interventions and policies to enhance educational outcomes in these fundamental areas.","SDGAlignment":"4.2, 4.2.1 (R) (Tier 2) & 4.3, 4.3.1 (Tier 2)","UnitOfMeasurement":"Percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annual","source_organisation_1":"2016 - 202021  Annual Statistical Digest - MoE (Meeting and Exceeding Standard)","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"SOC2-03-01"},"SOC4-7-1":{"indicator_number":"SOC4-7-1","goal_number":"SOC4","goal_name":"global_goals.SOC4-title","target_number":"SOC4-7","target_name":"global_targets.SOC4-7-title","indicator_name":"indicators.SOC4-7-1-title","PillarCode":"SOC","PillarDescription":"pillars.SOC","GoalId":"SOC4","GoalDescription":"global_goals.SOC4-title","PolicyObjectiveId":"SOC4-7","PolicyObjectiveDescription":"global_targets.SOC4-7-title","IndicatorId":"SOC4-7-1","IndicatorDescription":"indicators.SOC4-7-1-title","national_geographical_coverage":"Vanuatu","AlternativeDataSource":null,"Assumptions":null,"Calculation/Formulation":null,"Definition":null,"FrequencyofCollection":null,"IndicatorShortName":"Youth Participation in Organized Sport","IntendedDirection":null,"Limitations":null,"NSDPIndicatorID":"SOC 4.7.1","OtherDemandSources":null,"PillarName":"Society","PolicyLinkage":null,"PreferredDataSource":null,"PrimaryCollectionSystem":null,"Purpose/Rationale":null,"Range":null,"RelatedLinks":null,"ResponsibleAgency":null,"SourceTag":null,"national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-04-29","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Proportion of youth actively participating in at least one organised sport in the last 12 months by gender","graph_type":"bar","reporting_status":"notstarted","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"SOC4-07-01"},"ECO1-1-2":{"indicator_number":"ECO1-1-2","goal_number":"ECO1","goal_name":"global_goals.ECO1-title","target_number":"ECO1-1","target_name":"global_targets.ECO1-1-title","indicator_name":"indicators.ECO1-1-2-title","PillarCode":"ECO","PillarDescription":"pillars.ECO","GoalId":"ECO1","GoalDescription":"global_goals.ECO1-title","PolicyObjectiveId":"ECO1-1","PolicyObjectiveDescription":"global_targets.ECO1-1-title","IndicatorId":"ECO1-1-2","IndicatorDescription":"indicators.ECO1-1-2-title","national_geographical_coverage":"Vanuatu","Proxy":"","Definition":"GDP growth refers to the increase in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of a country over a specific period of time, typically measured on an annual basis.

","Concept":"A country that imports more goods and services that it exports in terms of value has a trade deficit or a negative trade balance. Conversely, a country that exports more goods and services than it imports has a trade surplus or a psoitive trade balance.","Disaggregation":"country","Rationale":"Economists use the Balance of Trade to measure the relative strength of a country's economy. The rationale behind analyzing the balance of trade includes the following points:\n\n1. Trade Surplus or Deficit: The balance of trade reveals whether a country has a trade surplus or a trade deficit. A trade surplus occurs when a country's exports exceed its imports, indicating that it is earning more foreign currency than it is spending. A trade deficit, on the other hand, occurs when imports exceed exports, suggesting that the country is spending more foreign currency than it is earning. The balance of trade helps assess the competitiveness of a nation's industries and its ability to generate wealth through exports.\n\n2. Economic Competitiveness: Analyzing the balance of trade allows policymakers and economists to gauge a country's economic competitiveness in global markets. A consistently positive balance of trade indicates that a country's goods and services are in demand internationally, potentially reflecting its competitive advantage in certain industries. Conversely, a persistent trade deficit may raise concerns about a country's competitiveness and its ability to sustain economic growth.\n\n3. Domestic Production and Consumption: The balance of trade provides insights into the domestic production and consumption patterns of a country. A trade surplus suggests that the country's domestic industries are productive and can meet domestic demand while exporting the surplus. In contrast, a trade deficit might indicate that the country relies heavily on imports to meet domestic consumption, which could have implications for domestic industries and employment.\n\n4. Foreign Exchange Reserves: The balance of trade affects a country's foreign exchange reserves, which are crucial for maintaining currency stability and covering external obligations. A trade surplus leads to an inflow of foreign currency, bolstering a country's foreign exchange reserves and providing greater flexibility in managing its currency. Conversely, a trade deficit implies an outflow of foreign currency, potentially depleting foreign exchange reserves and exposing the country to currency risks.\n\n5. Policy Implications: The balance of trade influences policy decisions. A trade surplus might suggest the need to focus on export promotion, support domestic industries, and potentially implement policies to address currency appreciation. In contrast, a trade deficit may lead to considerations such as import substitution policies, efforts to boost domestic production, or initiatives to enhance export competitiveness.\n\nUnderstanding the balance of trade helps policymakers, economists, and analysts assess a country's economic performance, identify trade patterns, determine areas of strength or weakness, and formulate appropriate policies to address trade imbalances and promote sustainable economic growth.","MethodOfComputation":"The formula for calculating the Balance of Trade can be simplified as the total value of exports minus the total value of its imports.","SDGAlignment":"17.11\n17.11.1\n(Tier 1)","UnitOfMeasurement":"Millions of Vatu (VT)","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annual","source_organisation_1":"VBOS, trade

total estimated value of trade agreements as a proportion of GDP refers to the value of trade covered by various agreements in relation to a country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). It is a measure that helps assess the significance of trade agreements in the context of a country's overall economic output.","Concept":"The concept of the total estimated value of trade agreements as a proportion of GDP is a measure that examines the value of trade covered by agreements in relation to a country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). It helps gauge the significance of trade agreements in the context of a nation's overall economic output.\nThis indicator provides insights into the potential impact of trade agreements on a country's economy. A higher proportion suggests that a considerable share of a country's trade is conducted under favorable conditions enabled by the agreements. This can lead to increased market access, reduced barriers to trade, and enhanced economic cooperation with partner countries.","Disaggregation":"import, export","Rationale":"The rationale behind considering the total estimated value of trade agreements as a proportion of GDP lies in the understanding that international trade plays a vital role in a country's economic development. Here are some key rationales for examining this indicator:\n\n1. Economic Integration: Trade agreements promote economic integration by establishing preferential trade arrangements among participating countries. By quantifying the value of trade covered by these agreements as a proportion of GDP, policymakers and analysts can assess the extent of economic integration and interdependence between countries. Higher proportions indicate a deeper level of integration and collaboration.\n\n2. Market Access: Trade agreements often grant participating countries improved market access by reducing trade barriers such as tariffs, quotas, and non-tariff barriers. The higher the proportion of trade covered by agreements in relation to GDP, the greater the market access and potential for increased export opportunities for businesses in the participating countries. This can lead to expanded markets, increased sales, and economic growth.\n\n3. Trade Diversification: Trade agreements can encourage diversification of a country's export markets and sources of imports. A higher proportion of trade covered by agreements implies that a significant portion of a country's trade is conducted with partner countries under favorable terms. This diversification helps reduce dependence on a limited number of trading partners and provides resilience against economic shocks.\n\n4. Investment and Economic Growth: Trade agreements often include provisions to facilitate foreign direct investment (FDI) flows. When the proportion of trade covered by agreements is substantial relative to GDP, it signals an environment conducive to investment and economic growth. Trade agreements can attract foreign investors seeking access to larger markets and a stable business environment, thereby stimulating economic activity and creating job opportunities.\n\n5. Competitive Advantage: The total estimated value of trade agreements as a proportion of GDP reflects the competitiveness of participating countries. A higher proportion suggests that these countries have a comparative advantage in certain sectors and industries, enabling them to capture a significant share of trade under favorable terms. This competitiveness can drive productivity, innovation, and specialization, enhancing overall economic performance.\n\n6. Economic Stability: Trade agreements can contribute to economic stability by fostering predictable and transparent trading rules. When a substantial portion of a country's trade is governed by stable trade agreements, it reduces uncertainty and the risk of abrupt disruptions in trade flows. This stability provides a conducive environment for businesses to plan investments, engage in long-term contracts, and drive sustained economic growth.\n\nBy examining the total estimated value of trade agreements as a proportion of GDP, policymakers, economists, and analysts can gain insights into the level of economic integration, market access, diversification, investment potential, competitiveness, and stability associated with the trade agreements. These factors are essential for formulating effective trade policies, attracting investments, and promoting sustainable economic development.","MethodOfComputation":"To calculate this indicator, the total estimated value of trade covered by trade agreements is divided by the country's GDP and expressed as a percentage. The trade covered by agreements can include both imports and exports between the participating countries, which enjoy preferential terms and reduced barriers as a result of the trade agreements.","SDGAlignment":"17.10\n17.10.1\n(Tier 1)","UnitOfMeasurement":"percentage (%)","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annual","source_organisation_1":"VBOS, trade statistics","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2023-06-27","national_data_updated_date":"2022-11-22","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Percentage (%)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Total estimated value of trade agreement as proportion of GDP","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Years","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ECO1-06-02"},"ENV2-6-1":{"indicator_number":"ENV2-6-1","goal_number":"ENV2","goal_name":"global_goals.ENV2-title","target_number":"ENV2-6","target_name":"global_targets.ENV2-6-title","indicator_name":"indicators.ENV2-6-1-title","PillarCode":"ENV","PillarDescription":"pillars.ENV","GoalId":"ENV2","GoalDescription":"global_goals.ENV2-title","PolicyObjectiveId":"ENV2-6","PolicyObjectiveDescription":"global_targets.ENV2-6-title","IndicatorId":"ENV2-6-1","IndicatorDescription":"indicators.ENV2-6-1-title","national_geographical_coverage":"Vanuatu","AlternativeDataSource":null,"Assumptions":null,"Calculation/Formulation":null,"ComputationMethod":"New project proposals developed by the Department f Environment under the Ministry of Climate Change and Adaptation (MoCCA), reviewed by the executive of MoCCA for submission to the NPP committee for their review and approval.","ComputationUnit":"Monetary figures(vt), percentage (%)","Concept":"* The idea of creating new environmental initiatives is increasing to support our sustainable environment development aspirations.

Here's a general approach to calculating this indicator:\n\n1. Define the target population: Determine the specific population or geographic area for which you want to measure access to early warning technologies. It could be a national population, a specific region, or a community.\n\n2. Identify relevant technologies: Determine the technologies that are considered early warning systems in the context you are assessing. This may include mobile phones, internet access, radio and television networks, weather monitoring systems, etc.\n\n3. Collect data on technology access: Gather data on the availability and usage of the identified technologies within the target population. This can be obtained through surveys, census data, or existing reports from relevant agencies or organizations.\n\n4. Determine access criteria: Define the criteria for considering someone to have access to early warning technologies. For example, it could be based on ownership or regular usage of mobile phones, internet access at home or public facilities, access to radio or television broadcasts, etc.\n\n5. Calculate the proportion: Calculate the proportion of the target population that meets the access criteria for each technology. Divide the number of individuals with access by the total population and multiply by 100 to obtain the percentage.\n\n   Proportion = (Number of individuals with access / Total population) x 100\n\n6. Aggregate the proportions: If you are assessing multiple technologies, calculate the proportion for each technology separately, and then aggregate them to obtain an overall measure. This could be done by averaging the proportions or assigning different weights based on the significance of each technology.\n\n7. Interpretation and analysis: Analyze the calculated proportion to understand the level of access to early warning technologies within the population. Compare the results over time or across different regions or demographic groups to identify disparities, trends, or improvements in access.\n\nIt's important to note that the accuracy and reliability of the measurement depend on the quality and representativeness of the data collected. Additionally, the specific context and objectives may require customization of the computation method.","SDGAlignment":"13.1, 13.1.1, 13.2.1 (R), (Tier 3)","UnitOfMeasurement":"percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"10 years","source_organisation_1":"2020 NPHC, VBOS","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2023-06-29","national_data_updated_date":"2023-05-29","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Proportion of population with access to technologies that conveys early warnings","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Year","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ENV3-02-02"},"ECO1-5-1":{"indicator_number":"ECO1-5-1","goal_number":"ECO1","goal_name":"global_goals.ECO1-title","target_number":"ECO1-5","target_name":"global_targets.ECO1-5-title","indicator_name":"indicators.ECO1-5-1-title","PillarCode":"ECO","PillarDescription":"pillars.ECO","GoalId":"ECO1","GoalDescription":"global_goals.ECO1-title","PolicyObjectiveId":"ECO1-5","PolicyObjectiveDescription":"global_targets.ECO1-5-title","IndicatorId":"ECO1-5-1","IndicatorDescription":"indicators.ECO1-5-1-title","national_geographical_coverage":"Vanuatu","AlternativeDataSource":null,"Assumptions":null,"Calculation/Formulation":null,"Definition":null,"FrequencyofCollection":null,"IndicatorShortName":"Value of Accrued Trade Benefit From Trade Agreements","IntendedDirection":null,"Limitations":null,"NSDPIndicatorID":"ECO 1.5.1","OtherDemandSources":null,"PillarName":"Economy","PolicyLinkage":null,"PreferredDataSource":null,"PrimaryCollectionSystem":null,"Purpose/Rationale":null,"Range":null,"RelatedLinks":null,"ResponsibleAgency":null,"SourceTag":null,"national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-04-29","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Benefits/value accrued through various trade agreements","graph_type":"bar","reporting_status":"notstarted","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ECO1-05-01"},"census":{"national_geographical_coverage":"Vanuatu","data_show_map":true,"indicator_name":"Population from census","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"VNSO","standalone":true,"national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-04-29","computation_units":"Total","graph_title":"Population from census","graph_type":"bar","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_number":"census","target_number":"census","goal_number":"census","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"indicator_sort_order":"census"},"ECO1-1-1":{"indicator_number":"ECO1-1-1","goal_number":"ECO1","goal_name":"global_goals.ECO1-title","target_number":"ECO1-1","target_name":"global_targets.ECO1-1-title","indicator_name":"indicators.ECO1-1-1-title","PillarCode":"ECO","PillarDescription":"pillars.ECO","GoalId":"ECO1","GoalDescription":"global_goals.ECO1-title","PolicyObjectiveId":"ECO1-1","PolicyObjectiveDescription":"global_targets.ECO1-1-title","IndicatorId":"ECO1-1-1","IndicatorDescription":"indicators.ECO1-1-1-title","national_geographical_coverage":"Vanuatu","Proxy":"","Definition":"The change in underlying inflation rate refers to the difference in the rate of inflation when certain volatile or temporary factors are excluded from the calculation.

Value of national trade: The value of national trade represents the monetary worth or financial value of goods traded between countries over a specific period. It is usually measured in terms of the total import and export values, reflecting the prices at which goods are bought and sold in international markets. The value of national trade provides insights into the economic significance of trade activities and the financial impact on participating countries.\n\n2. Volume of national trade: The volume of national trade refers to the physical quantity or quantity of goods traded between countries, irrespective of their monetary value. It is often measured in terms of weight, quantity, or unit of measurement (e.g., tons, barrels, units). The volume of national trade helps analyze the physical scale and magnitude of trade flows, indicating the actual quantities of goods exchanged between nations.\n\nBoth the value and volume of national trade are crucial indicators in understanding the scale, dynamics, and economic impact of international trade. While the value reflects the monetary worth of traded goods, the volume provides insights into the physical quantities involved, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis of trade patterns and their implications for economic growth and development.","Concept":"The main concept behind the indicator \"value and volume of national trade/merchandise trade\" is to capture and analyze the flow of goods exchanged between countries. It focuses on assessing the monetary value and physical quantity of traded goods, providing insights into the economic significance, scale, and dynamics of international trade. Monitoring the value and volume of national trade helps understand the commercial relationships between nations, identify trade patterns, analyze economic performance, and inform policy decisions related to international trade.","Disaggregation":"Exports & Re-exports","Rationale":"The rationale behind monitoring the indicator \"value and volume of national trade/merchandise trade\" is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the economic impact and dynamics of international trade. It serves several key purposes:\n\n1. Economic Performance: Tracking the value and volume of national trade helps assess a country's economic performance and its integration into the global economy. Increasing trade volumes and values often indicate economic growth and prosperity, while declining figures can signal potential challenges.\n\n2. Trade Patterns: Analyzing the value and volume of national trade enables the identification of trade patterns, such as the types of goods being traded, the countries involved, and the direction of trade flows. This information is valuable for identifying comparative advantages, evaluating market opportunities, and optimizing trade strategies.\n\n3. Policy Decisions: Governments and policymakers rely on data related to the value and volume of national trade to make informed decisions. It helps shape trade policies, negotiate trade agreements, assess the impact of tariffs and barriers, and develop strategies to promote domestic industries and exports.\n\n4. Global Economic Relations: Understanding the value and volume of national trade enhances the comprehension of a country's position in global economic relations. It allows for benchmarking against other countries, analyzing competitiveness, and identifying potential areas for cooperation or economic diversification.\n\n5. Economic Integration: Monitoring trade values and volumes assists in assessing the degree of economic integration between countries. It provides insights into the interdependencies and connections established through trade relationships, contributing to the evaluation of regional economic integration efforts and the overall globalization of markets.\n\nBy tracking the value and volume of national trade, policymakers, economists, businesses, and researchers gain valuable insights into the economic health, competitiveness, and opportunities associated with international trade. It helps inform strategic decisions, facilitates economic growth, and promotes sustainable development","MethodOfComputation":"The methods of computation for tracking the value and volume of national trade, also known as merchandise trade, involve collecting data from various sources such as customs records, trade statistics, and national accounts. The specific methodologies may vary across countries, but here are the general approaches used:\n\n1. Value of national trade: The value of national trade is calculated by adding the total export values and total import values for a specific time period. These values are typically obtained from customs data or trade databases, where the prices of exported and imported goods are recorded. The total export value represents the monetary worth of goods sold to other countries, while the total import value represents the monetary worth of goods purchased from other countries.\n\n2. Volume of national trade: The volume of national trade refers to the physical quantity or quantity of goods traded. It is often measured using units such as weight (e.g., tons), quantity (e.g., number of units), or other relevant metrics. The volume of trade is typically obtained through data on the physical quantities of goods exported and imported. This data can be derived from various sources, such as trade surveys, shipping records, or official statistics.\n\nTo calculate the volume of national trade, the physical quantity of each traded item is aggregated for a specific time period. This allows for the determination of the total volume of goods exported and imported by Vanuatu.","SDGAlignment":"8.a\n8.a.1 (Tier 1)","UnitOfMeasurement":"Vatu in million","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annual","source_organisation_1":"2018 QSI December (p15, added total volume reported in tonnes), VNSO\n2020 QSI December (added total volume reported in tonnes), VBOS\n2021 QSI December ( added total volume reported in tonnes), VBOS","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2023-06-26","national_data_updated_date":"2022-11-12","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"VT (vatu in millions)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Value and Volume of National Trade/Merchandise Trade","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Years","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ECO1-04-01"},"SOC6-1-3":{"indicator_number":"SOC6-1-3","goal_number":"SOC6","goal_name":"global_goals.SOC6-title","target_number":"SOC6-1","target_name":"global_targets.SOC6-1-title","indicator_name":"indicators.SOC6-1-3-title","PillarCode":"SOC","PillarDescription":"pillars.SOC","GoalId":"SOC6","GoalDescription":"global_goals.SOC6-title","PolicyObjectiveId":"SOC6-1","PolicyObjectiveDescription":"global_targets.SOC6-1-title","IndicatorId":"SOC6-1-3","IndicatorDescription":"indicators.SOC6-1-3-title","national_geographical_coverage":"Vanuatu","AlternativeDataSource":null,"Assumptions":null,"Calculation/Formulation":null,"ComputationMethod":"Subtract your current year total subsidies by last year's total subsidies, then divide by last year's subsidies.

It provides insights into the rate at which food prices are increasing or decreasing compared to other goods and services in the economy.","Concept":"The Food Price Index specifically focuses on tracking the price movements of a basket of food items, which may include grains, fruits, vegetables, meat, dairy products, and other essential food commodities. It is designed to capture the average changes in food prices over time.","Disaggregation":"Port Vila, Luganville","Rationale":"Comparing the Food Price Index to the national consumer price index allows for an understanding of how food prices are evolving in relation to the general price level in the economy. If the Food Price Index increases at a faster rate than the national consumer price index, it indicates that food prices are rising more rapidly compared to other goods and services. Conversely, if the Food Price Index grows at a slower pace or declines compared to the national consumer price index, it suggests that food prices are increasing at a slower rate or experiencing deflation relative to other prices.\n\nMonitoring the Food Price Inflation Rate or Food Price Index compared to the national consumer price index helps policymakers, economists, and consumers assess the affordability of food, understand inflationary pressures, and make informed decisions regarding food consumption, market interventions, and monetary policies.","MethodOfComputation":"The computation method for the Food Price Inflation Rate or Food Price Index compared to the national consumer price index involves several steps:\n\n1. Selection of Food Basket: A representative basket of food items is chosen to reflect the typical consumption patterns of households. This basket may include various food categories such as grains, fruits, vegetables, meat, dairy products, and other essential food commodities.\n\n2. Data Collection: Price data for the selected food items are collected regularly from various sources such as markets, retailers, or surveys. The data should cover a sufficiently large sample and be representative of different regions or markets within the country.\n\n3. Price Index Calculation: The price index for food is calculated by comparing the current average prices of the food basket with the prices of the same basket in a chosen base period. The index is typically expressed as a percentage.\n\n4. Consumer Price Index (CPI) Calculation: The national consumer price index, which represents the overall price level of goods and services in the economy, is also calculated using a similar methodology. It considers the prices of a broader range of goods and services beyond just food.\n\n5. Comparison of Food Price Index with CPI: The Food Price Index is compared to the national consumer price index to assess the relative price movement of food compared to other goods and services. This comparison provides insights into whether food prices are rising or falling at a different rate compared to the overall price level.\n\nBy analyzing the changes in the Food Price Index relative to the CPI over time, it is possible to determine the Food Price Inflation Rate and understand the direction and magnitude of changes in food prices compared to other prices in the economy.","SDGAlignment":"2.c.1 (Tier 3)","UnitOfMeasurement":"percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually, Quarterly","source_organisation_1":"VBOS, Market Survey & CPI Data","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2023-09-27","national_data_updated_date":"2021-08-19","computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Food Price Inflation Rate or Food Price Index compared to the national consumer price index (how much are prices for food going up or down, relative to all prices in the country-based on VNSO data)","graph_type":"line","reporting_status":"complete","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ENV1-03-03"},"ENV5-6-1":{"indicator_number":"ENV5-6-1","goal_number":"ENV5","goal_name":"global_goals.ENV5-title","target_number":"ENV5-6","target_name":"global_targets.ENV5-6-title","indicator_name":"indicators.ENV5-6-1-title","PillarCode":"ENV","PillarDescription":"pillars.ENV","GoalId":"ENV5","GoalDescription":"global_goals.ENV5-title","PolicyObjectiveId":"ENV5-6","PolicyObjectiveDescription":"global_targets.ENV5-6-title","IndicatorId":"ENV5-6-1","IndicatorDescription":"indicators.ENV5-6-1-title","national_geographical_coverage":"Vanuatu","AlternativeDataSource":null,"Assumptions":null,"Calculation/Formulation":null,"ComputationMethod":"(Number of government agencies accessing centralised environmental data system) /  (total number of government agencies) x 100","ComputationUnit":"Percentage (%)","Concept":"Environmental management information system (EMIS), is an environmental data base that was established within the department of Environmental Protection and Conservation (DEPC) in 2018 funded by UNDP, under a project called, Mainstreaming Global Environmental priorities into national policies and programmes (CB2/CCCD Project).

Here are some rationales for considering this indicator:\n\n1. Economic Contribution: Vanuatu's economy heavily relies on agriculture, with the sector playing a significant role in employment, income generation, and GDP contribution. Assessing the level of production of major commodities helps understand the economic impact of agriculture and its contribution to overall economic development in Vanuatu.\n\n2. Export Potential: Vanuatu's major commodities often have export potential, contributing to foreign exchange earnings and trade balance. Tracking the production levels of these commodities provides an indication of the country's export capacity and its ability to tap into international markets. It helps identify opportunities for expanding exports, diversifying markets, and reducing dependence on specific commodities.\n\n3. Food Security: Agriculture is crucial for domestic food security and nutrition. Monitoring the production of major commodities allows policymakers to assess the country's self-sufficiency in staple foods and identify any potential gaps in meeting the nutritional needs of the population. It helps guide strategies to promote domestic food production, reduce import dependence, and ensure a stable food supply for the people of Vanuatu.\n\n4. Employment and Livelihoods: Agriculture is a significant source of employment and livelihoods for many people in Vanuatu, particularly in rural areas. The level of production of major commodities reflects the labor demand and the income-generating opportunities available in the agricultural sector. Understanding the dynamics of commodity production helps policymakers address employment challenges, support rural development, and improve livelihoods for farmers and their communities.\n\n5. Sectoral Planning and Policy Formulation: Data on the production of major commodities assists in sectoral planning and policy formulation for agriculture. It helps identify areas of strength and weakness, determine priorities for investment, and guide interventions to enhance productivity, sustainability, and competitiveness in specific commodity sectors. This information enables evidence-based decision-making and targeted policies to support agricultural development.\n\n6. Climate Resilience and Adaptation: Vanuatu is vulnerable to climate change impacts that can significantly affect agricultural production. Monitoring the production of major commodities provides insights into the resilience of the agricultural sector and its capacity to adapt to climate-related challenges.

average incidence of food poverty at the household level, also known as the Food Poverty Line, refers to the proportion or percentage of households within a given population that do not have access to

It serves as a measure to assess the extent of food insecurity and poverty within a given area or country. The Food Poverty Line is typically determined by estimating the minimum income or expenditure required to meet basic nutritional needs, considering factors such as regional dietary patterns and nutritional guidelines. By comparing the income or expenditure of households to this threshold, those falling below it are considered to be living in food poverty. Monitoring the average incidence of food poverty enables policymakers and organizations to gauge the prevalence and severity of food insecurity, identify social inequalities, and design targeted interventions to address food poverty and promote food security.","Disaggregation":"Urban, Rural","Rationale":"The indicator of the average incidence of food poverty at the household level, or the Food Poverty Line, is a crucial measure that provides valuable insights into the state of food insecurity and poverty within a population. Its rationale lies in the need to identify and address the challenges faced by households in accessing an adequate and nutritious diet. By quantifying the proportion of households living in food poverty, policymakers and organizations can assess the scale and scope of the issue, enabling them to design targeted interventions and policies to alleviate hunger and improve food security. This indicator helps in understanding the economic well-being and social inequalities prevailing in a society, as well as in evaluating the effectiveness of poverty reduction strategies. It also serves as a monitoring tool to track progress over time and to compare food poverty rates across different regions or countries, facilitating evidence-based decision-making and resource allocation to tackle the underlying causes of food insecurity. Ultimately, the aim is to ensure that all individuals and households have access to sufficient and nutritious food, promoting their well-being and contributing to a more equitable and sustainable society","MethodOfComputation":"The average incidence of food poverty at the household level is calculated by comparing the income or expenditure of each household to the Food Poverty Line. If a household's income falls below this threshold, it is considered to be living in food poverty.

It creates opportunities for entrepreneurs to establish and grow businesses, contributing to economic development, job creation, and improved livelihoods. The agriculture, forestry, and fisheries sector provide essential resources, while the industry and service sectors offer diverse economic activities. Entrepreneurs can leverage these sectors to harness the country's natural resources, cultural heritage, and service-oriented industries, driving sustainable growth and prosperity in Vanuatu.\n","Disaggregation":"","Rationale":"* To measure the wages and benefits \n* For policy making \n* For job security & protection","MethodOfComputation":"To compute the working population in Vanuatu using census data, you can follow these steps:\n\nObtain Census Data: Access the latest available census data for Vanuatu, which provides information on population demographics, employment status, and occupation. The census data should include details on the working population and their distribution across sectors.\n\nIdentify Relevant Categories: Look for specific categories or variables in the census data that capture employment status and occupation. These categories may include \"employed,\" \"unemployed,\" \"labor force,\" or similar indicators that differentiate between individuals who are part of the working population and those who are not.\n\nExtract Sector-specific Information: Within the working population category, focus on extracting data related to the agriculture, forestry, and fisheries sector, the industry sector, and the service sector. This can be done by identifying occupation codes or job categories that correspond to these sectors in the census data.\n\nTabulate the Data: Calculate the number of individuals falling within each sector by summing up the counts or percentages associated with the identified categories. This will provide you with the working population figures for the agriculture, forestry, and fisheries sector, the industry sector, and the service sector separately.","SDGAlignment":"8.8, 8.8.1, 8.8.2","UnitOfMeasurement":"percentage (%)","FrequencyOfCollection":"National Population & Housing Census (10 years)","source_organisation_1":"2020 Population and Household Census , VBOS\n","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2023-06-28","national_data_updated_date":"2023-05-22","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Percentage (%)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"","graph_titles":[{"series":"Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery","unit":"Percentage of working age population (15-65)","title":"Working age population (15-65) for Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery"},{"series":"Industry","unit":"Percentage of working age population (15-65)","title":"Working age population (15-65) for Industry"},{"series":"Service","unit":"Percentage of working age population (15-65)","title":"Working age population (15-65) for Service"}],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Year","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ECO4-06-01"},"infrastructure":{"composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Vanuatu Infrastructures","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_available":"","indicator_name":"Vanuatu Infrastructure Statistics","indicator_number":"Vanuatu infrastructure","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"national_geographical_coverage":"Vanuatu","page_content":"Infrastructure is the foundation for developing urban and rural areas, operating industries and commerce, improving living\nstandards, delivering community services and driving economic growth as well as impacting the progress of social and environment  development goals towards achieving their target.
