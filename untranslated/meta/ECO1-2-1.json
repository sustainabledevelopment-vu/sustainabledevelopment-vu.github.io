It represents the increase or decrease in the total funds received by the government, which can have implications for budgetary planning, fiscal policy decisions, and the overall financial health of the government.","Concept":"The concept behind the indicator \"change in government revenue\" is to assess the variation in the total amount of funds collected by the government from various sources. It helps track the growth or decline in government income, which is essential for understanding the financial health of the government, evaluating the effectiveness of revenue policies, and making informed decisions regarding budget allocation, public spending, and fiscal planning. Monitoring changes in government revenue provides insights into the overall revenue generation capacity of the government and its ability to meet its financial obligations and support public services and programs.","Disaggregation":"By revenue sources: taxes, value added, excise, taxes on inter-trade & transactions, and other","Rationale":"The rationale behind monitoring the indicator \"change in government revenue\" is to understand the trends and fluctuations in the total funds collected by the government over time. It provides crucial information on the government's ability to generate income, sustain public services, meet financial obligations, and make informed decisions on budgetary allocations, tax policies, and expenditure planning. Monitoring changes in government revenue helps assess the financial health of the government and its capacity to support economic growth and address societal needs.","MethodOfComputation":"Percentage Change in Government Revenue = ((Revenue in the current period - Revenue in the previous period) / Revenue in the previous period) * 100\n\nThis formula determines the percentage difference between the revenue collected in the current period and the revenue collected in the previous period, relative to the revenue in the previous period. The result indicates the percentage increase or decrease in government revenue over the specified time frame.","SDGAlignment":"17.1\n17.1.1(Tier 1)\n17.1.2 (Tier 1)","UnitOfMeasurement":"Vatu in Millions","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annual","source_organisation_1":"2019 and 2020 Total Revenue from QSI fourth quarter, VBOS","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2023-06-26","national_data_updated_date":"2022-02-08","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"VT (vatu in millions)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Change in government revenue (GFS Tables)","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Years","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ECO1-02-01"}
