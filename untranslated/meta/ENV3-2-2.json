Here's a general approach to calculating this indicator:\n\n1. Define the target population: Determine the specific population or geographic area for which you want to measure access to early warning technologies. It could be a national population, a specific region, or a community.\n\n2. Identify relevant technologies: Determine the technologies that are considered early warning systems in the context you are assessing. This may include mobile phones, internet access, radio and television networks, weather monitoring systems, etc.\n\n3. Collect data on technology access: Gather data on the availability and usage of the identified technologies within the target population. This can be obtained through surveys, census data, or existing reports from relevant agencies or organizations.\n\n4. Determine access criteria: Define the criteria for considering someone to have access to early warning technologies. For example, it could be based on ownership or regular usage of mobile phones, internet access at home or public facilities, access to radio or television broadcasts, etc.\n\n5. Calculate the proportion: Calculate the proportion of the target population that meets the access criteria for each technology. Divide the number of individuals with access by the total population and multiply by 100 to obtain the percentage.\n\n   Proportion = (Number of individuals with access / Total population) x 100\n\n6. Aggregate the proportions: If you are assessing multiple technologies, calculate the proportion for each technology separately, and then aggregate them to obtain an overall measure. This could be done by averaging the proportions or assigning different weights based on the significance of each technology.\n\n7. Interpretation and analysis: Analyze the calculated proportion to understand the level of access to early warning technologies within the population. Compare the results over time or across different regions or demographic groups to identify disparities, trends, or improvements in access.\n\nIt's important to note that the accuracy and reliability of the measurement depend on the quality and representativeness of the data collected. Additionally, the specific context and objectives may require customization of the computation method.","SDGAlignment":"13.1, 13.1.1, 13.2.1 (R), (Tier 3)","UnitOfMeasurement":"percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"10 years","source_organisation_1":"2020 NPHC, VBOS","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2023-06-29","national_data_updated_date":"2023-05-29","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Proportion of population with access to technologies that conveys early warnings","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Year","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ENV3-02-02"}
