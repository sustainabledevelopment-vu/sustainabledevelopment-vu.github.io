The census data should include details on the working population and their distribution across sectors.\n\nIdentify Relevant Categories: Look for specific categories or variables in the census data that capture employment status and occupation. These categories may include \"employed,\" \"unemployed,\" \"labor force,\" or similar indicators that differentiate between individuals who are part of the working population and those who are not.\n\nExtract Sector-specific Information: Within the working population category, focus on extracting data related to the agriculture, forestry, and fisheries sector, the industry sector, and the service sector. This can be done by identifying occupation codes or job categories that correspond to these sectors in the census data.\n\nTabulate the Data: Calculate the number of individuals falling within each sector by summing up the counts or percentages associated with the identified categories. This will provide you with the working population figures for the agriculture, forestry, and fisheries sector, the industry sector, and the service sector separately.","SDGAlignment":"8.8, 8.8.1, 8.8.2","UnitOfMeasurement":"percentage (%)","FrequencyOfCollection":"National Population & Housing Census (10 years)","source_organisation_1":"2020 Population and Household Census , VBOS\n","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2023-06-28","national_data_updated_date":"2023-05-22","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Percentage (%)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"","graph_titles":[{"series":"Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery","unit":"Percentage of working age population (15-65)","title":"Working age population (15-65) for Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery"},{"series":"Industry","unit":"Percentage of working age population (15-65)","title":"Working age population (15-65) for Industry"},{"series":"Service","unit":"Percentage of working age population (15-65)","title":"Working age population (15-65) for Service"}],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Year","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ECO4-06-01"}
