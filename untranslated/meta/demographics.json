Demographic data offers one source of reliable data that provides valuable insights about a community\u2019s future infrastructure needs, resource allocation, and demand for services. With Vanuatu being the most disaster affected country in the world, these statistics are especially important for emergency planning. They also help determine where aid and assistance programs are targeted, what businesses might move to your community, and how your vote counts in an election. All area council, constituency, provincial and national plans, which present a vision for growth and development, should include a section dedicated to demographic trends that informs and/or relates to the community vision.\u200b\n\n> **Note** Official population counts were collected during the 2016 (mini) and 2020 National Population and Household Census.
