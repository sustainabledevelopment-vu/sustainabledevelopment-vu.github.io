It is a measure used to assess the extent of food insecurity and poverty in a specific area or country.","Concept":"The concept of the average incidence of food poverty at the household level, also known as the Food Poverty Line, refers to the percentage or proportion of households within a specific population that lack access to a sufficient and nutritious diet due to financial constraints. It serves as a measure to assess the extent of food insecurity and poverty within a given area or country. The Food Poverty Line is typically determined by estimating the minimum income or expenditure required to meet basic nutritional needs, considering factors such as regional dietary patterns and nutritional guidelines. By comparing the income or expenditure of households to this threshold, those falling below it are considered to be living in food poverty. Monitoring the average incidence of food poverty enables policymakers and organizations to gauge the prevalence and severity of food insecurity, identify social inequalities, and design targeted interventions to address food poverty and promote food security.","Disaggregation":"Urban, Rural","Rationale":"The indicator of the average incidence of food poverty at the household level, or the Food Poverty Line, is a crucial measure that provides valuable insights into the state of food insecurity and poverty within a population. Its rationale lies in the need to identify and address the challenges faced by households in accessing an adequate and nutritious diet. By quantifying the proportion of households living in food poverty, policymakers and organizations can assess the scale and scope of the issue, enabling them to design targeted interventions and policies to alleviate hunger and improve food security. This indicator helps in understanding the economic well-being and social inequalities prevailing in a society, as well as in evaluating the effectiveness of poverty reduction strategies. It also serves as a monitoring tool to track progress over time and to compare food poverty rates across different regions or countries, facilitating evidence-based decision-making and resource allocation to tackle the underlying causes of food insecurity. Ultimately, the aim is to ensure that all individuals and households have access to sufficient and nutritious food, promoting their well-being and contributing to a more equitable and sustainable society","MethodOfComputation":"The average incidence of food poverty at the household level is calculated by comparing the income or expenditure of each household to the Food Poverty Line. If a household's income falls below this threshold, it is considered to be living in food poverty. The average incidence is then calculated as the percentage of households below the Food Poverty Line within a given population.","SDGAlignment":"14.7.1 (Tier 3)","UnitOfMeasurement":"percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"5 years","source_organisation_1":"2019 HIES ","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2023-09-27","national_data_updated_date":"2023-05-22","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Percenatge of population (%)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Average incidence of food poverty at the household level (Food Poverty Line)","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[{"organisation":"","periodicity":"","earliest_available":"","geographical_coverage":"","url":"","url_text":"","release_date":"","next_release":"","statistical_classification":"","contact":"","other_info":"","logo":""}],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"2019 Data","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ENV1-01-03"}
