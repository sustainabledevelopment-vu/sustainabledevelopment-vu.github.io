If there is too much flexibility, the value of the commitment is undermined. If there is too little flexibility, countries may refuse to make deep commitments or may easily renege on such commitments. This section explores how this trade-off works. It reviews the economic rationale for international trade cooperation and explains the reason for the inclusion of flexibilities in a trade agreement. It is important to highlight the distinction between the initial motivations for introducing flexibilities and the consequences of using such flexibilities. This section focuses on the reasons for including flexibilities while the effects of specific measures are examined in Sections\n\nEconomists have identified several rationales for the existence of trade agreements, such as those embodied in the WTO, and its antecedent, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). \n\nTwo main approaches can be distinguished.\n1.\tThe first states that in the absence of a trade agreement, a country may be tempted to manipulate the terms-of-trade (i.e. the price of its exports relative to its imports) in order to increase its national income at the expense of its trading partners.\n2.\t The economic and political difficulties that governments face in setting trade policies. \u201cTrade agreements allow governments to escape terms-of-trade conflicts and/ or to resist pressures from the private sector and special-interest groups urging the government to deviate from a liberal trade policy.\u201d","RelatedLinks":null,"ResponsibleAgency":null,"SDGAlignment":"10.a.1 (Tier 1)","SourceTag":null,"TargetDescription":"By 2030 improve by 15%","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-05-04","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-05-04: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Vanuatu-National-Statistics-Office/vnso-nsdp-platform/commit/8e5162095cccae66986459d1b22669e0e3d2c6f9","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-03-10: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Vanuatu-National-Statistics-Office/vnso-nsdp-platform/commit/a1113682325527f03b072a04c93fc156ea9d5201","computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Trade agreement analysis reports","graph_type":"bar","reporting_status":"notstarted","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator":"ECO1.6.1","target_id":"ECO1.6","sdg_goal":"ECO1","indicator_sort_order":"ECO1-06-01"}
