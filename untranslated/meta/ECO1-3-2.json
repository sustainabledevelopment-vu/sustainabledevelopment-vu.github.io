By comparing what a country owes with what it produces, the debt-to-GDP ratio reliably indicates that particular country\u2019s ability to pay back its debts. Often expressed as a percentage, this ratio can also be interpreted as the number of years needed to pay back debt, if GDP is dedicated entirely to debt repayment.\nA country able to continue paying interest on its debt--without refinancing, and without hampering economic growth, is generally considered to be stable. A country with a high debt-to-GDP ratio typically has trouble paying off external trades (also called \u201cpublic debts\u201d), which are any balances owed to outside lenders. In such scenarios, creditors are apt to seek higher interest rates when lending. Extravagantly high debt-to-GDP ratios may deter creditors from lending money altogether.","DataSource":"Ministry of Finance & Economic Management (MFEM)","Definition":"Dept ratio to GDP is the ratio between a country\u2019s government dept (measured in units of currency) and its gross domestic product (GDP) (Measured in units of currency per year). A low dept \u2013 to \u2013 GDP ratio indicates an economy that produces and sells goods and services sufficient to pay back its depts without incurring further dept.","Dissaggregation":"National","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","FrequencyofCollection":null,"IndicatorShortName":"Dept to GDP Ratio","IntendedDirection":null,"Limitations":null,"NSDPIndicatorID":"ECO 1.3.2","OtherDemandSources":null,"PillarName":"Economy","PolicyLinkage":null,"PreferredDataSource":null,"PrimaryCollectionSystem":null,"Proxy":"No","Purpose/Rationale":null,"Range":null,"Rationale":"* Depicts the proper management of use of public funds and that funds are directed for its purposes.\n\n* Determines the GDP of the country\n* Depicts the dept the country has to pay off","RelatedLinks":null,"ResponsibleAgency":null,"SDGAlignment":"","SourceTag":null,"TargetDescription":"By 2030 fall by 30%","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-05-04","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-05-04: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Vanuatu-National-Statistics-Office/vnso-nsdp-platform/commit/8e5162095cccae66986459d1b22669e0e3d2c6f9","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-03-10: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Vanuatu-National-Statistics-Office/vnso-nsdp-platform/commit/a1113682325527f03b072a04c93fc156ea9d5201","computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Debt ratio to GDP (inclusive of SOE generated debt)","graph_type":"bar","reporting_status":"notstarted","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator":"ECO1.3.2","target_id":"ECO1.3","sdg_goal":"ECO1","indicator_sort_order":"ECO1-03-02"}
