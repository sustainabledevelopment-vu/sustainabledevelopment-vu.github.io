It assesses the extent to which people have access to adequate sanitation services that protect human health and dignity.\n\nThis indicator takes into account the availability, accessibility, and usability of sanitation facilities that meet certain standards of hygiene and privacy. Improved sanitation facilities include flush toilets, piped sewer systems, septic tanks, ventilated improved pit latrines, composting toilets, or other sanitation technologies that effectively separate human waste from human contact and prevent its contamination of the environment.","Concept":"The concept behind this indicator is to assess the progress and effectiveness of efforts to provide adequate sanitation services to the population. It considers factors such as the availability of improved sanitation facilities, their functionality, accessibility, and the practices and behaviors surrounding sanitation and hygiene.\n\nThe significance of this indicator lies in its contribution to public health, hygiene promotion, and human well-being. Access to improved sanitation facilities plays a vital role in preventing the spread of waterborne diseases, reducing exposure to health risks, and maintaining a clean and healthy environment.","Disaggregation":"urban, rural, province","Rationale":"Monitoring the proportion of the population with reliable access to improved sanitation facilities helps policymakers, governments, and organizations identify areas or populations that lack access and prioritize interventions to improve sanitation infrastructure, promote hygiene education, and foster behavior change. It also helps track progress towards national and international targets for ensuring universal access to adequate sanitation for all.\n\nIn summary, the \"Proportion of population with reliable access to improved sanitation facilities\" indicator serves as a measure of the extent to which a population has access to sanitation facilities that meet standards of hygiene and dignity. It emphasizes the importance of providing adequate sanitation services to protect public health, promote hygiene practices, and enhance the overall well-being of individuals and communities.","MethodOfComputation":"To calculate this indicator, data is collected through surveys, censuses, or other data collection methods that specifically inquire about the availability and usage of improved sanitation facilities. The number of people with access to reliable and improved sanitation facilities is divided by the total population surveyed or considered, and the result is expressed as a percentage.","SDGAlignment":"6.2\n6.2.1(R) (Tier 1)","UnitOfMeasurement":"percentage","FrequencyOfCollection":"10 year census","source_organisation_1":"VBOS 2009 & 2020 Census","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2023-06-27","national_data_updated_date":"2023-06-01","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Proportion of population with reliable access to improved sanitation facilities","graph_titles":[{"series":"proportion of population","unit":"percentage","title":"Proportion of population access to improved sanitation facilities"},{"series":"population","unit":"total count","title":"Population access to improved sanitation facilities"}],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Years","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ECO2-02-02"}
