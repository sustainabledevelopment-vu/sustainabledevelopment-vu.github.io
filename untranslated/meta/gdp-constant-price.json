For example, current price data shown for 2000 are based on 2000 prices, for 2010 are based on 2010 prices, and so on. Constant series show the data for each year in the value of a particular base year. Thus, for example, data reported in constant 2010 prices show data for 1990, 2000, and all other years in 2010 prices. Current series are influenced by the effect of price inflation. Constant series are used to measure the true growth of a series, i.e. adjusting for the effects of price inflation. For example (using year one as the base year), suppose nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rises from 100 billion to 110 billion, and inflation is about 4%. In real prices, the second year GDP would be approximately 106 billion, reflecting its true growth of 6%.\n","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":true,"tags":[],"target_number":"gdp-constant-price","goal_number":"gdp-constant-price","indicator_sort_order":"gdp-constant-price"}
