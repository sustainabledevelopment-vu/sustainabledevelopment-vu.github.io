These products undergo some form of processing or transformation, such as refining, manufacturing, packaging, or other value-added activities.\n\nThe purpose of producing these local products is twofold:\n\n1. Domestic consumption: They are intended for use within the country or region where they are produced. These products cater to the local market and fulfill the demands and needs of the population residing within that area.\n\n2. Export: The products are also manufactured with the intention of being sold and distributed in international markets. They are meant for consumption by customers located outside the country or region of origin. Exporting local products allows a country to generate revenue, boost economic growth, and enhance its trade relations with other nations.\n\nThe \"Total number\" in this context represents the aggregate count of these processed local products. It could be measured in terms of individual units, such as kilograms, liters, pieces, or any other appropriate unit of measurement based on the nature of the product.\n\nThe timeframe considered for this measurement is \"per annum,\" which means it represents the production and processing of local products over a one-year period.","Concept":"To find the total number of processed local products produce annually for domestic consumption and export so that Vanuatu can look for ways to increase by 10% production and processing niche commodities by 2020.","Disaggregation":"","Rationale":"To depict total number of processed local products produced per anum for domestic consumption and export. So that production of processed local products must increase by 10% by the year 2020. And therefore, enabling a competitive business environment and creating more opportunities and employments for entrepreneurs throughout Vanuatu.","MethodOfComputation":"For products intended for export, trade data can be utilized. Customs department and statistics trade organizations maintain records of exports, including the quantity or volume of goods shipped to different destinations. By analyzing this trade data, you can determine the total number of processed local products exported during a given period.","SDGAlignment":"9.b.1\n (Tier 2)","UnitOfMeasurement":"vatu in millions","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"VBOS Trade Statistics","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2023-06-28","national_data_updated_date":"2023-05-31","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Total value in millions of vatu","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Total number of processed local products produced per annum for domestic consumption and export","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Years","progress":[{"target":"progress.target1","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"progress.cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ECO4-03-01"}
