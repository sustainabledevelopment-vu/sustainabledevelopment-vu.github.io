Together they articulate a path for Vanuatu to emerge as a much stronger nation, renewing its traditions and values, and creating economic opportunities for all. The implementation of the goals will depend on a strengthened social contract between the government and the people it serves. It requires the active participation of civil society, the private sector and our international development partners.\n\nThe Plan sets 15 goals under three pillars (Society, Environment, and Economy), 98 policy objectives, 196 indicators and 205 targets. The society pillar seeks to ensure we maintain a vibrant cultural identity underpinning a peaceful, just and inclusive society that is supported by responsive and capable institutions, delivering quality services to all citizens. The environment pillar seeks to ensure a pristine natural environment on land and at sea that continues to serve our food, cultural, economic and ecological needs, and enhance resilience and adaptive capacity to climate change and natural disasters. The economy pillar seeks to ensure we have a stable economy based on equitable, sustainable growth that creates jobs and income earning opportunities accessible to all people in rural and urban areas.\n\nNational reporting on sustainable development in Vanuatu\nThe Vanuatu National Statistics Office in partnership with the Department of Strategic Policy, Planning &amp; Aid Coordination is responsible for coordinating and publishing national data for Vanuatu on the NSDP indicators and for statistical reporting on Vanuatu’s progress in this area.\n\nData Flow Chart (Create one for Vanuatu)\nIn September 2021, the Vanuatu National Statistics Office activated the online platform for the indicators of the NSDP. Here you can find time series and associated metadata for Vanuatu on national sustainable development in a processed and interactive form. The area on the NSDP on the online platform enables the responsible international organizations (custodian agencies) to download the data for individual NSDP indicators for Vanuatu directly and use them, for example, for global reporting.\n","id":""},"/about/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/about/","title":"Vanuatu’s National Sustainable Development Plan\n","content":"The National Sustainable Development Plan sets 15 goals under three pillars (Society, Environment, and Economy), 98 policy objectives, 196 indicators and 205 targets.

The economy pillar seeks to ensure we have a stable economy based on equitable, sustainable growth that creates jobs and income earning opportunities accessible to all people in rural and urban areas.\n\nVia the Online Platform\n\nThe NSDP Platform is an adaptation of the Open SDG Platform, with Vanuatu being the first country globally to localise it to its national development needs. The Platform was built exclusively with open-source libraries and tools and can be hosted and maintained using free services. The key features of this platform are its ability to read data and visualise the information through graphs, tables and maps. The Platform facilitates Vanuatu to gather, disseminate, and track national or local data on the NSDP indicators, including identification of data gaps. Additionally, it improves access to official statistics and metadata; enabling Vanuatu to report national data in a harmonised format; and improving communication between data producers and users, custodian agencies, and other stakeholders.\n\nStructure of the NSDP online platform\n\nThe NSDP online platform is structured according to pillars, goals, policy objectives and the associated indicators. The Department of Strategic Policy, Planning &amp; Aid Coordination (DSPPAC) reviews the strategy and its indicators in partnership with all government departments and adjusts them if necessary. For example, indicators can be replaced, or new ones added. Each NSDP indicator is shown on its own page individually or together with an indicator that is closely related in terms of content. The development of the indicator and - as far as possible - the target to be achieved for Vanuatu are visualized in a graphic. The definitions and intentions as well as the development of the indicators are explained in the meta-data. For some indicators, the data can also be disaggregated. However, the indicated target to be achieved remains the nationwide target.\n\nEvaluation of the indicators\n\nFor most indicators, a weather symbol - from sunshine to thunderstorms - shows in an easy-to-understand way how the indicator is moving on the desired path towards the target. Explanations on the definition of the symbols can be found here. Weather symbols for the last four years can be found under the “INDICATOR OVERVIEW” button on the respective indicator page. Using the weather symbols, it is possible to roughly estimate how stable the development has been recently. However, they do not replace the explanatory texts with their background information. At the top of the NSDP page, you can click on the “EVALUATION” button and select “INDICATOR OVERVIEW” to display the entire temporal development of the weather symbols for all indicators.\n\nTechnical background\n\nIn order to be able to present the data in a processed form, the open source project Open SDG on GitHub offers a standardized template for an online platform. You can find more about this under Technical Notes.\n","id":""},"/area-council-profiles/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/area-council-profiles/","title":"Area council profiles\n","content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

For example, current price data shown for 2000 are based on 2000 prices, for 2010 are based on 2010 prices, and so on. Constant series show the data for each year in the value of a particular base year. Thus, for example, data reported in constant 2010 prices show data for 1990, 2000, and all other years in 2010 prices. Current series are influenced by the effect of price inflation. Constant series are used to measure the true growth of a series, i.e. adjusting for the effects of price inflation. For example (using year one as the base year), suppose nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rises from 100 billion to 110 billion, and inflation is about 4%.

Tracking the budgets and expenses of the nation in line with its implementation of the targets, which are aligned with national development priorities, will give the opportunity for all stakeholders to assess how much the various goals and metrics have been accomplished over the years, laying the groundwork for determining how much more will be needed to realise the NSDP. The transparent reporting on government’s spending to achieve the NSDP provides both Private Sector and Multilateral Development Partners the opportunity to determine which goals require more attention, or the Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) that require financial or technical assistance in working towards the achievement of the Goals. It also provides the Government the opportunity to adjust its allocations to ensure the equitable distribution of resources across MDAs. This reporting seeks to provide data that will enable the Government and its partners to monitor the progress being made on the various Goals against the investments made over the years to ascertain the efficient use of all financial resources.\n","id":"government.financial.statistics"},"/indicator-overview/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/indicator-overview/","title":"Status Overview- assessment for Vanuatu from previous years\n","content":"\n","id":""},"/labour/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/labour/","title":"Vanuatu Labour.\n","content":"\n","id":""},"/methodology/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/methodology/","title":"Indicators Status Summary\n","content":"As means of providing at-a-glance information on the status of the sustainability indicators, every indicator is assigned, if calculable, one of four “weather symbols” in the report. This symbol is neither a political appraisal nor a forecast. Instead, the symbols provide a first impression of developments but do not replace a study of the explanatory texts, further analyses and background information. The manner in which the symbols are assigned to the individual indicators depends on the formulation of the respective target.\n\nIndicators with absolute or relative target values\n\nIn most of the cases an indicator is supposed to reach a concrete absolute or relative target value by a target year (for example indicator ECO 1.5.3). In the case of such a target formulation, first the average annual change over the last five years is calculated by means of the last six data points. This value is imputed for all years up to the target year. Building on this development, a hypothetical target value is calculated and compared to the predefined target value of the indicator. Based on the resulting difference between these two values, the indicators are assigned one of the following symbols:\n\n  If the development continued, the target value would be reached or missed by less than 5% of the difference between the target value and the current value.\n\n  If the development continued, the target would presumably be missed by at least 5%, but no more than 20% of the difference between the target value and the current value.\n\n  Although the indicator is developing in the desired direction towards the target, if the development continues, the target in the target year would be missed by more than 20% of the difference between the target value and the current value.\n\n  The distance to the target is constantly high or increasing. The indicator is not developing in the desired direction.\n\nIn exceptional cases where there are not enough data for the above mentioned calculation to be carried out, the last four consecutive points of time for which data are available will, as a minimum, be used to calculate the average change. In the case of less than four suitable annual values, there will be no calculation.\n\nIndicators with directional targets without specific target values\n\nIn cases where only the targeted direction of the indicator trend is given but no concrete target value (for example indicator ENV 1.1.3), two pieces of information are combined for evaluation: primarily, the average change over the last five years and, subordinately, the last annual change.\n\n•\tIf both the average value and the last annual change point in the right direction, the symbol shown is a sun.    \n•\tIf the average trend is moving in the right direction but the last year was characterised by a trend in the wrong direction or no change at all, the sun is partly hidden by a cloud.   \n•\tIf, on the contrary, the average value points in the wrong direction or indicates stagnation while the last year appears to mark a turn in the desired direction, a cloud is shown.   \n•\tIf neither the average value nor the last change point in the right direction, the symbol shown is a thunderstorm.   \n\nIndicators with several target values\n\nIf several targets are defined for one indicator that are to be reached at the same time (for example indicator 10.1), the development is evaluated individually for each target. The most negative evaluation determines the weather symbol to be assigned to the indicator.\n\nComparison of evaluations over time\n\nThe synoptic table provides information also about the evaluation of an indicator in previous years. It shows if the weather symbol assigned to an indicator was rather stable or volatile in the past years.\n","id":""},"/news/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/news/","title":"News &amp; Events\n","content":"Check this page for news regarding the reporting of our statistics for national indicators and opportunities to contribute to measuring achievement of the NSDP goals\n","id":""},"/publications/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/publications/","title":"National Sustainable Development Plan Baseline Survey\n","content":"The NSDP Baseline Survey is an expanded Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) and is inclusive of health educational, cultural, and productive dimensions previous uncollected or in need of updating. The Baseline Survey has provided vital information for informing policy at the highest level in Vanuatu — decisions on future programmes and projects undertaken by the government and development partners will use data collected through this major household survey. The NSDP Baseline Survey produced a comprehensive data set expected to report on 38 key NSDP monitoring and evaluation indicators and 23 UN Sustainable Development Goal target indicators, making it the largest and most informative household survey we have undertaken as a nation. Teams collected data in all six provinces and both urban centres for the entirety of the collection period visiting roughly 4,800 randomly selected households across 39 islands. The survey was financed by the Government of Vanuatu, with significant support from the Republic of India through the newly established Commonwealth Window of the India-UN Development Partnership Fund.\n\n2019-2020 NSDP Baseline Survey- summary tables report\n\n2019-2020 NSDP Baseline Survey- wellbeing in Vanuatu report\n\n2019-2020 NSDP Baseline Survey- labour market monograph report\n\n2019-2020 NSDP Baseline Survey- food security in Vanuatu report\n\n2019-2020 NSDP Baseline Survey- hardship in Vanuatu report\n\n2019-2020 NSDP Baseline Survey- food security facsheet\n\n2019-2020 NSDP Baseline Survey- survey technical report\n\n2019-2020 NSDP Baseline Survey- analysis reference tables report\n\nAnnual Development Report\n\nThis Annual Development Report (ADR) provides an overview of annual progress of implementing Vanuatu 2030, The Peoples Plan.

GitHub is where over 65 million developers shape the future of software, together. The Vanuatu National Statistics Office is the first government instiution in the Pacific to enhance evidence based decision-making through the application of GitHub. Data scientists need to use Github for much the same reason that software engineers do — for collaboration, ‘safely’ making changes to projects and being able to track and rollback changes over time. It is, therefore, becoming more and more important that data scientists are proficient in the use of version control.\n\nA universal version of the code developed by the US, UK and the Center for Open Data Enterprise for an online platform is available. The NSDP online platform is based on this. If you are interested, we recommend that you review the SDG online platforms in the USA and Great Britain and the corresponding Open SDG project documentation to familiarise. This contains technical instructions on how, for example, a copy of the Open SDG online platform can be created.\n\n•\tSDG online platform USA   \n•\tSDG online platform Great Britain   \n\nIf you

With Vanuatu being the most disaster affected country in the world, these statistics are especially important for emergency planning. They also help determine where aid and assistance programs are targeted, what businesses might move to your community, and how your vote counts in an election. All area council, constituency, provincial and national plans, which present a vision for growth and development, should include a section dedicated to demographic trends that informs and/or relates to the community vision.​\n\n\n  Note Official population counts were collected during the 2016 (mini) and 2020 National Population and Household Census.
