They absorb large amounts of scarce capital on which they provide very low returns, at the same time divert government resources away from vital social investments in health and education, and drive-up the costs of doing business where they are the sole service providers. Therefore, it is really important to identify the proportion of SOE\u2019s who have already submitted their annual reports because it can be used as a measure for performances of the SOE\u2019s which are aligned to the Government priorities. And also, to help with the reforms of State-Owned Enterprises in relation to their performances and the delivery of the services and support they provide to all citizens of Vanuatu.
