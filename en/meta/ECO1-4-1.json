Value of national trade: The value of national trade represents the monetary worth or financial value of goods traded between countries over a specific period. It is usually measured in terms of the total import and export values, reflecting the prices at which goods are bought and sold in international markets. The value of national trade provides insights into the economic significance of trade activities and the financial impact on participating countries.\n\n2. Volume of national trade: The volume of national trade refers to the physical quantity or quantity of goods traded between countries, irrespective of their monetary value. It is often measured in terms of weight, quantity, or unit of measurement (e.g., tons, barrels, units). The volume of national trade helps analyze the physical scale and magnitude of trade flows, indicating the actual quantities of goods exchanged between nations.\n\nBoth the value and volume of national trade are crucial indicators in understanding the scale, dynamics, and economic impact of international trade. While the value reflects the monetary worth of traded goods, the volume provides insights into the physical quantities involved, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis of trade patterns and their implications for economic growth and development.","Concept":"The main concept behind the indicator \"value and volume of national trade/merchandise trade\" is to capture and analyze the flow of goods exchanged between countries. It focuses on assessing the monetary value and physical quantity of traded goods, providing insights into the economic significance, scale, and dynamics of international trade. Monitoring the value and volume of national trade helps understand the commercial relationships between nations, identify trade patterns, analyze economic performance, and inform policy decisions related to international trade.","Disaggregation":"Exports & Re-exports","Rationale":"The rationale behind monitoring the indicator \"value and volume of national trade/merchandise trade\" is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the economic impact and dynamics of international trade. It serves several key purposes:\n\n1. Economic Performance: Tracking the value and volume of national trade helps assess a country's economic performance and its integration into the global economy. Increasing trade volumes and values often indicate economic growth and prosperity, while declining figures can signal potential challenges.\n\n2. Trade Patterns: Analyzing the value and volume of national trade enables the identification of trade patterns, such as the types of goods being traded, the countries involved, and the direction of trade flows. This information is valuable for identifying comparative advantages, evaluating market opportunities, and optimizing trade strategies.\n\n3. Policy Decisions: Governments and policymakers rely on data related to the value and volume of national trade to make informed decisions. It helps shape trade policies, negotiate trade agreements, assess the impact of tariffs and barriers, and develop strategies to promote domestic industries and exports.\n\n4. Global Economic Relations: Understanding the value and volume of national trade enhances the comprehension of a country's position in global economic relations. It allows for benchmarking against other countries, analyzing competitiveness, and identifying potential areas for cooperation or economic diversification.\n\n5. Economic Integration: Monitoring trade values and volumes assists in assessing the degree of economic integration between countries. It provides insights into the interdependencies and connections established through trade relationships, contributing to the evaluation of regional economic integration efforts and the overall globalization of markets.\n\nBy tracking the value and volume of national trade, policymakers, economists, businesses, and researchers gain valuable insights into the economic health, competitiveness, and opportunities associated with international trade. It helps inform strategic decisions, facilitates economic growth, and promotes sustainable development","MethodOfComputation":"The methods of computation for tracking the value and volume of national trade, also known as merchandise trade, involve collecting data from various sources such as customs records, trade statistics, and national accounts. The specific methodologies may vary across countries, but here are the general approaches used:\n\n1. Value of national trade: The value of national trade is calculated by adding the total export values and total import values for a specific time period. These values are typically obtained from customs data or trade databases, where the prices of exported and imported goods are recorded. The total export value represents the monetary worth of goods sold to other countries, while the total import value represents the monetary worth of goods purchased from other countries.\n\n2. Volume of national trade: The volume of national trade refers to the physical quantity or quantity of goods traded. It is often measured using units such as weight (e.g., tons), quantity (e.g., number of units), or other relevant metrics. The volume of trade is typically obtained through data on the physical quantities of goods exported and imported. This data can be derived from various sources, such as trade surveys, shipping records, or official statistics.\n\nTo calculate the volume of national trade, the physical quantity of each traded item is aggregated for a specific time period. This allows for the determination of the total volume of goods exported and imported by Vanuatu.","SDGAlignment":"8.a\n8.a.1 (Tier 1)","UnitOfMeasurement":"Vatu in million","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annual","source_organisation_1":"2018 QSI December (p15, added total volume reported in tonnes), VNSO\n2020 QSI December (added total volume reported in tonnes), VBOS\n2021 QSI December ( added total volume reported in tonnes), VBOS","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2023-06-26","national_data_updated_date":"2022-11-12","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"VT (vatu in millions)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Value and Volume of National Trade/Merchandise Trade","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Years","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ECO1-04-01"}
