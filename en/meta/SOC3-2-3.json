The population considered is the population at risk of the disease.","Rationale":"To measure trends in malaria morbidity and to identify locations where the risk of disease is highest. With this information, programmes can respond to unusual trends, such as epidemics, and direct resources to the populations most in need. This data also serves to inform global resource allocation for malaria such as when defining eligibility criteria for Global Fund finance.","ComputationMethod":"(number of Malaria annual parasite) / (total pop) X 100","ComputationUnit":"Percentages (%)","Proxy":"Yes","Disaggregation":"\u2022 Age\n\u2022 Geographic location\n\u2022 Sex","DataSource":"Health Information System  (HIS) | Vanuatu Ministry of Health","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","source_organisation_1":"2015 Health Data, Malaria and Vector Borne Diseases Unit, MoH (from M&E Framework)","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-06-09","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-06-09: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Vanuatu-National-Statistics-Office/vnso-nsdp-platform/commit/b56c4852da91e40d7d13ce441d60171edfb61aae","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-03-10: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Vanuatu-National-Statistics-Office/vnso-nsdp-platform/commit/a1113682325527f03b072a04c93fc156ea9d5201","computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Malaria annual parasite incidence rate","graph_type":"bar","reporting_status":"notstarted","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator":"SOC3.2.3","target_id":"SOC3.2","sdg_goal":"SOC3","indicator_sort_order":"SOC3-02-03"}
