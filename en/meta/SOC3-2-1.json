PAD causes your blood vessels to narrow and reduces blood flow to your legs and feet. It may also cause nerve damage, known as peripheral neuropathy. The most common amputations in people with diabetes are the toes, feet, and lower legs.","ComputationMethod":"(number of diabetic amputation)/(total pop) X 100","ComputationUnit":"percentage (%)","Proxy":"No","Disaggregation":"\u2022\tAge\n\u2022\tGeographic location\n\u2022\tSex","DataSource":"Health Information System Ministry of Health Vanuatu","FrequencyOfCollection":"Monthly & Annually ","source_organisation_1":"","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-06-08","national_data_updated_date":"2023-05-29","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Number of Diabetic (NCD) related amputations","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Years","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"SOC3-02-01"}
