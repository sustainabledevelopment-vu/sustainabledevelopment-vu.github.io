These agreements typically cover a range of issues, such as the reduction or elimination of tariffs, the removal of non-tariff barriers, the facilitation of customs procedures, and the protection of intellectual property rights. The purpose of such agreements is to promote the flow of goods and services between participating countries, enhance market access, and foster economic growth and development. They are often negotiated and established through rounds of negotiations and can have a significant impact on international trade and economic relations.","Concept":" Trade by Trade agreement suggests a focus on the specific trade aspects or provisions within such agreements. It emphasizes the importance of trade-related policies, market access, tariffs, quotas, and regulations that directly impact the exchange of goods and services between participating countries.\n\nBy examining the trade provisions within a trade agreement, policymakers, economists, and analysts can evaluate the potential benefits, challenges, and implications for industries, consumers, and the overall economy. It allows for an assessment of how the agreement affects trade flows, market opportunities, and competitiveness, and provides insights into the impact on specific sectors or industries. Understanding the trade provisions in a trade agreement is crucial for businesses engaging in cross-border trade, as it shapes the rules and conditions under which they can access foreign markets and compete internationally.","Disaggregation":"exports, imports, balance,\nby country","Rationale":"The rationale behind monitoring trade by trade agreements as an indicator is to understand the economic relationships and trade dynamics between two or more specific countries. Trade by trade agreements are established to promote economic cooperation and reduce barriers to trade between the participating countries. Monitoring these agreements provides insights into the objectives, terms, and conditions of trade between the countries involved. It allows policymakers, businesses, and economists to assess the impact of these agreements on market access, tariff reductions, regulatory alignment, investment flows, and other trade-related aspects. Understanding bilateral trade agreements helps identify opportunities and challenges for businesses operating in the involved countries, evaluate the effectiveness of trade policies, and assess the potential for increased trade and economic cooperation between specific trading partners.","MethodOfComputation":"The computation methods can include the following:\n\n1. Total Trade Value: Calculate the total value of exports and imports between the countries involved in the multilateral trade agreement. This can be done by summing up the monetary value of all traded goods and services recorded in official trade statistics or trade databases.\n\n2. Trade Balance: Calculate the trade balance between the countries by subtracting the total value of imports from the total value of exports. A positive trade balance indicates that exports exceed imports, while a negative trade balance suggests that imports surpass exports.\n\n3. Tariff Revenue: Assess the tariff revenue generated from trade flows between the countries. This involves calculating the total amount of customs duties collected on imports and exports based on the agreed tariff rates. This information can be obtained from customs records or official government reports.\n\n4. Sector-specific Analysis: Conduct a sector-specific analysis to determine the value of trade in specific industries or sectors covered by the multilateral trade agreement. This can involve examining the monetary value of trade in key sectors and tracking changes over time to evaluate the impact of the agreement on those sectors.\n\n5. Preferential Tariff Analysis: Analyze the utilization of preferential tariff rates agreed upon in the multilateral trade agreement. Calculate the share of imports and exports that receive preferential treatment and assess the value of trade conducted at lower tariff rates as a result of the agreement.\n\nMonitoring multilateral trade agreements in monetary value requires access to reliable trade data, such as official trade statistics, customs records, and other relevant sources. Regular data collection, analysis, and comparison against the commitments and objectives of the agreement help assess the economic impact, trade patterns, and compliance with the agreed terms.","SDGAlignment":"17.11\n17.11.1\n(Tier 1)","UnitOfMeasurement":"Vatu in millions","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annual","source_organisation_1":"QSI December 2020, VBOS\nQSI December 2021, VBOS","source_organisation_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2023-06-26","national_data_updated_date":"2022-11-22","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"VT (vatu in millions)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"footer_fields":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_series_breaks":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_target_lines":[],"graph_title":"Trade by trade agreement (value)","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_available":"","indicator_tabs":{"override":false,"tab_1":"","tab_2":"","tab_3":"","tab_4":""},"page_content":"","permalink":"","placeholder":"","precision":[],"progress_status":"not_available","proxy":"","proxy_series":[],"publications":[],"related_indicators":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","sources":[],"standalone":false,"tags":[],"x_axis_label":"Years","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator_sort_order":"ECO1-05-02"}
