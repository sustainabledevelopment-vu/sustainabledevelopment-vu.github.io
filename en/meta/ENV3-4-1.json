The ministry of Education and teaching services has tried its best to incorporate the climate change and Disaster risk reduction modules into the curriculum so that it is thought in all public schools throughout Vanuatu.\n\n*Despite the fact that Vanuatu is amongst the vulnerable countries prone to natural hazards, responsible institutions (MoCCA, MoET) play a tremendous role in making sure Vanuatu is strong and resilient to all types of disaster by introducing modules in schools to educate students to know more on climate change and DRR and be disaster resilient citizens.\n\n* Increase in introducing and educating schools with climate change (CC) and Disaster risk reduction (DRR) modules by in cooperating these modules into the teaching curriculum in Vanuatu.

It aims to reduce the socio-economic vulnerabilities to disaster and at the same time dealing with the environmental and other hazards that trigger them.","Dissaggregation":"Schools (Vocational/Primary/Secondary/College)","FrequencyOfCollection":"Annually","FrequencyofCollection":null,"IndicatorShortName":"Public Schools Using CC & DRR Modules in National Curriculum","IntendedDirection":null,"Limitations":null,"NSDPIndicatorID":"ENV 3.4.1","OtherDemandSources":null,"PillarName":"Environment","PolicyLinkage":null,"PreferredDataSource":null,"PrimaryCollectionSystem":null,"Proxy":"No","Purpose/Rationale":null,"Range":null,"Rationale":"\n* Indicates the number of schools around Vanuatu that have access to climate change & disaster risk reduction modules at all levels of education.\n\n* Promotes climate change and disaster risk reduction in public schools and educate students the risks and possible measures to take in fight against climate change and be of disaster resilient.","RelatedLinks":null,"ResponsibleAgency":null,"SDGAlignment":"13.3.1 (Tier 3), 13.3.2 (Tier 3)","SourceTag":null,"TargetDescription":"85% of public schools using the climate change and disaster risk reduction modules in national curriculum at all levels","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-05-04","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-10","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-05-04: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Vanuatu-National-Statistics-Office/vnso-nsdp-platform/commit/8e5162095cccae66986459d1b22669e0e3d2c6f9","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-03-10: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Vanuatu-National-Statistics-Office/vnso-nsdp-platform/commit/a1113682325527f03b072a04c93fc156ea9d5201","computation_units":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Percentage of public schools using the climate change and disaster risk reduction modules in national curriculum at all levels","graph_type":"bar","reporting_status":"notstarted","progress":[{"target":"My progress target","years":[{"year":2021,"status":"Cloudy","image":"cloudy.png"}]}],"indicator":"ENV3.4.1","target_id":"ENV3.4","sdg_goal":"ENV3","indicator_sort_order":"ENV3-04-01"}
